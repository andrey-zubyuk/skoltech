Simulation of the West wind:

- field size is 15*17 (X*Y),
- time period is 0, ..., 9,
- detector is located at x = 9, y = 10,
- West wind direction is the axis "x" direction
  (from the "left" to the "right" of the field),
- detector data is 0 for td = 0, ..., 2, and 5 for td = 3, ..., 9,
- such data correspond to one of the following sources of intensity 5:
  -- located at x = 9, y = 10 with emission start time = 3,
  -- located at x = 8, y = 10 with emission start time = 2,
  -- located at x = 7, y = 10 with emission start time = 1,
  -- located at x = 6, y = 10 with emission start time = 0.

Note that depending on parallel computing implementation the application can
select any of these equally optimal sources.

Launch with the command (from the project home directory)

    ./main examples/West_wind_3/A.npy examples/West_wind_3/n.csv

Example of console output (see the note about parallel computing above):

The tensor A loaded, shape: 15x17x10x10, A.min(): 0, A.max(): 1.
The tensor n loaded, n.min(): 0, n.max(): 5.
The source detected at x = 8, y = 10,
    intensity = 5,
    emission start time = 2.

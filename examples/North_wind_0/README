Simulation of the North wind:

- field size is 15*17 (X*Y),
- time period is 0, ..., 9,
- detector is located at x = 9, y = 10,
- North wind direction is the axis "y" opposite direction
  (from the "top" to the "bottom" of the field),
- detector data is constant: 1.2 for any td = 0, ..., 9,
- such data correspond to the only source of intensity 1.2
  with emission start time = 0 located at x = 9, y = 10.

Launch with the command (from the project home directory)

    ./main examples/North_wind_0/A.npy examples/North_wind_0/n.csv

Console output:

The tensor A loaded, shape: 15x17x10x10, A.min(): 0, A.max(): 1.
The tensor n loaded, n.min(): 1.2, n.max(): 1.2.
The source detected at x = 9, y = 10,
    intensity = 1.2,
    emission start time = 0.
